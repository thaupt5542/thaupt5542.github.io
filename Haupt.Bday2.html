<h2>Quote of the Day</h2>
<p title="I have the coolest daughter ever"> <q>Parents rarely let go of their children, so children let go of them. They move on. They move away. The moments that used to define them—a mother’s approval, a father’s nod—are covered by moments of their own accomplishments. It is not until much later, as the skin sags and the heart weakens, that children understand; their stories, and all their accomplishments, sit atop the stories of their mothers and fathers, stones upon stones, beneath the waters of their lives.</q> - The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom</p> <hr>
